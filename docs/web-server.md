# Local web server

Run `kuke serve` and open the printed URL (default `http://localhost:5129`).
The command runs in the foreground as your current user. Ctrl+C or SIGTERM
closes the HTTP listener and request-owned daemon connections; it does not stop
kukeond or workloads. The binary embeds all frontend assets and needs no Node.js
or external asset files at runtime.

## Dashboard and resource lists

The UI opens to a dashboard with summary counts for realms, spaces, stacks, and
cells and a breakdown of daemon-reported cell states. Select **Realms**,
**Spaces**, **Stacks**, or **Cells** in the sidebar to open its list across scopes.
Lists show name, reported state, and parent scope. Search by name or scope, filter
by realm, and use the paging controls for collections larger than 25 entries.

Select a resource name to open its overview. Choose **View document** in a list
row or overview to inspect its JSON document. Cell and container responses omit environment values; cell responses also omit materialization parameters and environment overrides.
Documents are not displayed automatically. A cell overview also lists its
containers; their overviews and documents include daemon runtime status.
Cell overviews include status cards for state, reported cgroup readiness, and
container observations, plus daemon reason/message and configuration-divergence
warnings. Container rows use the states reported in the cell's observations;
missing observations show **Not reported**. Container detail status cards show
state, restart count, valid timestamps, and repository/setup-stage outcomes.
Exit codes appear only for terminal states with a reported finish time. State
badges use text and color, and retained observations are marked stale on failure.
Documents remain available through **View document**.

Breadcrumbs link to parent resources. Overview links open a child list narrowed
to the selected scope, with **Clear scope** to return to all entries. URLs retain
the selected list, scope, resource, and document mode. Browser Back/Forward works,
and existing hierarchy bookmarks open the corresponding resource overview.

**Refresh** reloads the inventory and current detail. Dashboard counts are based
on daemon list calls with bounded concurrency. A failed scope read produces an
**Incomplete inventory** warning and counts exclude inaccessible resources. When
a refresh fails after a successful load, the prior inventory stays visible with a
**Stale inventory** warning; retained detail documents have their own stale notice.
Loading, empty collections, and searches with no matches have distinct messages.

The sidebar shows the selected daemon socket. **Connected** means the latest
inventory retrieval completed without failures, not that all workloads are
healthy. Permission errors mean the invoking user cannot access the selected
socket or resource; check permissions. **Daemon unavailable** identifies failed
daemon requests. Correct the connection and refresh to retry.

## Blueprints, configs, volumes, and secrets

The sidebar also provides **Blueprints**, **Configs**, **Volumes**, and **Secrets**.
Each has a searchable list across scopes, a realm filter, pagination, an overview,
and an optional complete JSON document. URLs preserve the kind and full scope,
including identically named resources at different levels. Scope breadcrumbs
open the relevant realm, space, stack, or cell.

Blueprints, configs, and volumes may be realm-, space-, or stack-scoped. Secrets
may also be cell-scoped. List responses expose metadata; open **View document**
to retrieve all fields supported by the daemon's detail API. Volume overviews
show the returned reclaim policy. Secret views display metadata only; secret
`spec.data` is cleared before HTTP serialization in both lists and details.

Config overviews show their explicit blueprint reference, including cross-realm
references. Explicit `secretRef` and `volumeRef` entries in supported documents
link to their full target scopes. Each reference reports checking, available,
missing, or retrieval-failed state. Template references are identified as such.
Bare volume sources are displayed without guessing which scope the daemon will
resolve at create/start. References describe usage, not ownership.

Refresh updates the current list/document and reference checks. Empty results,
loading, retrieval failures, missing targets, and retained stale data are shown
separately. No catalog data is read directly from daemon storage.

## Options and permissions

- `--listen`: `localhost` (default) or a literal loopback IP, including `::1`.
  Non-loopback addresses and other hostnames are rejected.
- `--port`: 5129 by default; 0 selects an available port. The printed URL always
  includes the actual bound port. A port conflict fails with a diagnostic.
- `--configuration`, `KUKE_CONFIGURATION`, `--host`, and `KUKEON_HOST` follow the
  normal client configuration rules. The endpoint must use the supported Unix
  socket transport. `KUKEON_NO_DAEMON` does not enable direct storage access.

The invoking user needs permission to connect to the configured kukeond socket.
The server never escalates privileges. If connection fails, the shell remains
available and API requests can be retried. A new connection is opened for each
request, allowing recovery after the daemon restarts.

Use exactly the printed host and port: Host and any browser Origin must match
that endpoint. No CORS allowance, accounts, sessions, or authentication tokens
are provided. Binding is limited to loopback, including when using `localhost`.

## Read-only API

All endpoints use same-origin HTTP GET and return JSON:

| Path                 | Result                                                                  |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/api/connection`    | Configured daemon `endpoint`; this is configuration, not a health probe |
| `/api/realms`        | Complete realm documents from kukeond, or `[]` when empty               |
| `/api/realms/{name}` | Complete selected realm document                                        |

Scoped endpoints follow the same hierarchy. Each collection returns `[]` when
empty; append `/{name}` for its document:

- `/api/realms/{realm}/spaces`
- `/api/realms/{realm}/spaces/{space}/stacks`
- `/api/realms/{realm}/spaces/{space}/stacks/{stack}/cells`
- `/api/realms/{realm}/spaces/{space}/stacks/{stack}/cells/{cell}/containers`

Each name is a URL-encoded path segment. Collections return daemon documents,
except containers, whose collection returns daemon container specs. No fields
are filtered from detail documents, and no direct resource-store reads are made.

Errors use `{ "error": { "code": "...", "message": "..." } }`:
`permission_denied` (403), `not_found` (404), `invalid_request` (400), or
`unavailable` (503). Requests time out after ten seconds. Responses are not cached.

```sh
kuke serve --listen 127.0.0.1 --port 5129
curl http://127.0.0.1:5129/api/realms
```

## Workspace layout and appearance

The sidebar holds the dashboard and resource-type destinations, daemon connection
information, and appearance controls. On small screens, the menu button opens the
sidebar; choosing a destination closes it. The main workspace shows summary
panels, a resource list, or a selected resource overview.

Use **Appearance** to choose **System**, **Light**, or **Dark**. System follows the
device preference, including changes while the page is open. Explicit choices
persist in this browser when local storage is available.

### Catalog HTTP API

- `GET /api/catalog/{blueprints|configs|volumes|secrets}` lists resources.
- `GET /api/catalog/{kind}/{name}` reads a complete daemon-exposed document.

Optional list query parameters `realm`, `space`, `stack`, and (secrets only)
`cell` filter the scope subtree. Detail queries require `realm` and use the exact
scope coordinates. Deeper coordinates require every shallower coordinate;
non-secret cell scope and scope gaps return `invalid_request` (400). Names and
query values must be URL-encoded. Missing resources return `not_found` (404).
Secret responses never include `spec.data`.

### Create a cell from a config

Open a config overview and choose **Create cell from config**. Enter an explicit
cell name, optional `KEY=VALUE` environment overrides, and the optional disk
pressure bypass. Review the materialized document before confirming. The target
scope comes from the config (missing space/stack use `default`), matching
`kuke create cell --from-config`; the target stack must already exist.
Creation uses the daemon's `MaterializeCell`, leaving the cell stopped.
Existing names are rejected. If inputs or the config change after preview,
preview again. A failed or disconnected creation can have reached the daemon;
refresh the Cells list before retrying.

The JSON POST endpoints `/api/cells/from-config/preview` and
`/api/cells/from-config/create` require the exact same Origin and
`Content-Type: application/json`. Preview is read only; create re-materializes
and checks the preview digest before submitting. Neither endpoint reads daemon
storage directly. Config parameters and secret references remain in the config;
the form does not accept arbitrary cell documents or template parameter overrides.
